# SOLID Coding in Python

The principle of SOLID coding is an acronym originated by Robert C. Martin, and it stands for five different conventions of coding.

### The SOLID principles are:

`The Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)`
`The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)`
`The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)`
`The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)`
`The Dependency inversion Principle (DIP)`
